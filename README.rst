autopalette
===========

Terminal palettes and themes, without tears.

::

   pip install autopalette

**Status: Alpha; being developed.**

Do you write python scripts that ``print()`` text on the command-line
terminal? Do you feel the interface could convey a bit more meaning, but
the effort needed to get it right has kept you away from using ANSI
colors? These things should be easy, right?

Here‚Äôs a regular Python program that prints a word:

.. code:: python

   print("Tring!")

Here is what it looks like with autopalette, using a shortcut called
``AutoFormat`` or in short: ``af``.

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af

   print(af("Tring!"))

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40859706-3b61f3c0-65d2-11e8-996b-da4e218e192c.png
   :alt: 02-autoformat-wrapped-print

   02-autoformat-wrapped-print

We added one line to import, and four characters around the string.

And it does nothing - autopalette is non-intrusive that way. You can
leave your ``af``-wrapped strings around and they will not run
unnecessary code until you ask for more.

What‚Äôs more?

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af

   print(af("Hello, world!").id)
   print(af("Hello, world!").id256)

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40859765-63bec9b0-65d2-11e8-886c-82011ea96f8b.png

   03-id-deterministic-color

If your terminal / emulator reports that it supports color, you should
see the second line formatted in fuschia/ magenta. Try changing the text
and observe that the color changes when the text changes, but it stays
fixed for the same text. Across function calls, across program runs,
across machines, across time itself! Okay maybe that was too dramatic,
but it is kind of true because, mathematics.

Autopalette‚Äôs ``id`` feature hashes the supplied text and generates a
color unique to the text within the range of colors reported by the
terminal. ``id256`` generates a color within the ANSI 256 palette.
``id256`` is not portable, but feel free to use it for your personal
scripts where color limits are known.

Why is this useful?

It helps to identify unique names that your program may output, such as:

-  hostnames, when working with remote machines.
-  usernames, for logs of multi-user environments.
-  you know better what matters to your program‚Äôs output :)

Sometimes you want a little more‚Ä¶

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af

   print(af("Hello again!").h1)

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40859801-858c3ef6-65d2-11e8-90d7-69a80fc57c57.png
   :alt: 04-header-one

   04-header-one

And we have a nicely decorated header, just like that. You can use one
of the several pre-defined styles, or read further below how you can
design your own.

Here are the various styles built into autopalette.

-  ``p``: plain-text, or paragraph - as you like to read it.
-  ``light``: where color range allows it, lighter text.
-  ``dark``: darker text if terminal supports enough colors within
   palette.
-  ``h1``: highlighted text style 1, or header-1.
-  ``h2``:
-  ``h3``
-  ``h4``
-  ``li``: list element.
-  ``err``: an error
-  ``warn``: a warning
-  ``info``: a warning
-  ``ok``: a warning
-  ``b``: bold.
-  ``i``: italic.
-  ``u``: underline.
-  ``r``: reversed colors.
-  ``raw``: useful to debug, displays the ANSI code instead of applying
   it.

Let us try superimposing two styles.

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af

   print(af("Hey! We've met before!?").info.b)

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40859850-abe90afc-65d2-11e8-905d-d8a875d0f021.png
   :alt: 05-superimpose-styles

   05-superimpose-styles

You get the idea, tack the names of styles you want at the end-bracket
of the call to ``af``.

If you are wondering, ‚ÄúWait, what‚Äôs with that weird syntax?‚Äù, in
Python‚Äôs spirit of quick protoyping, autopalette encourages
experimenting with minimal mental and physical effort to tweak knobs.
Your program‚Äôs actual task matters more, but you care enough about your
future self and users using the app to style it well and be a delight to
use. Autopalette‚Äôs syntax is an expriment to help manage this dilemma.

While you compose and read your code, this syntax separates the styling
from rest of the function calls. You don‚Äôt have to think about styling
unless you want to, and when you do, which is often as you look at the
string you just put together to print - assuming you started with
``af("``, close the quote and bracket, type out a style shortcut and you
are done.

Although, few times you want a bit more than that‚Ä¶

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af, GameBoyGreenPalette

   af.init(palette=GameBoyGreenPalette)

   print(af("There you are!").h1)

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860027-550d2046-65d3-11e8-9fbe-b0ecdf3ec50c.png
   :alt: 06-select-palette

   06-select-palette

Look at that! Yummy.

Autopalette goes the length to support a handful of palettes.

-  GameBoyChocolate
-  GameBoyOriginal
-  Grayscale
-  Oil
-  Arcade
-  CLRS

If this is exciting to you too, read further below how to create your
own!

How does this look on a terminal with only 16 colors?

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860055-74e898aa-65d3-11e8-8bfc-3873c1ea4a4b.png
   :alt: 06-select-palette-16-color

   06-select-palette-16-color

Not too shabby, eh?

How do you test how your app will look on terminals with limited colors?
Try these as prefix to your script invocation for a temporary change:

-  ``env TERM=vt100``
-  ``env TERM=rxvt-16color``
-  ``env TERM=xterm``
-  ``env TERM=xterm-256color``
-  ``env COLORTERM=truecolor``
-  ``env NO_COLOR``

like so:

``$ env TERM=xterm-256color python app.py``

To save a setting permanently, put ``export TERM=...`` in your
``~/.bash_profile`` or your default shell‚Äôs configuration.

If the environment variable NO_COLOR is set, autopalette honors the
configuration and disables all color. Same with redirected output and
pipes - autopalette will handle it fully automatically, if it fails to
do so, please open an issue in the tracker and I‚Äôll do my best to fix
it. In case you can fix the issue yourself, a pull request will be
awesome!

And we would be essentially done, except, there‚Äôs this little voice in
the head that‚Äôs saying something mojib¬™ke something, but it‚Äôs all
garbled up.

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af 

   af.init(fix_text=True)

   print(af("&macr;\\_(√£\x83\x84)_/&macr;").info)

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860106-abf343f4-65d3-11e8-9272-89733b0790bd.png
   :alt: 07-fix-text

Neat, with the ``fix_text`` option set, autopalette transparently passes
your text through ``ftfy``\ ‚Äôs ``fix_text()`` function call, ensuring
your application does not output garbage when badly encoded strings find
their way to your app‚Äôs print statement.

There‚Äôs more, not all terminal and emulators support unicode, and will
still produce garbage if we feed them strings that they do not know how
to display. Use the ``fix_all`` option to let autopalette and the
terminal it is running on figure out the rest.

.. code:: python

   from autopalette import af 

   af.init(fix_all=True)

   print(af("I üíõ Unicode!"))

Try this example with ``env TERM=vt100`` for the full cleanup!

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860125-c4f0343e-65d3-11e8-9bfe-d92f177c5852.png
   :alt: 08-fix-all

   08-fix-all

Note that fixing text and emoji requires additional libraries to be
loaded and can slow down startup time. If your program does not output
strings generated by other programs, (which includes strings received
from http APIs!) and the program is invoked repeatedly instead of
running for a while, you may want to skip ``fix_...`` options.

And that‚Äôs about it for three-line examples!

You can start your scripts with ``af.init(fix_all=True)`` and use
``af()`` to wrap your strings, even if you ignore colors and styles,
your program will display text correctly on most popular (and many
obscure) terminals.

Here‚Äôs the basic theme:

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860445-e69d057a-65d4-11e8-9926-228beaf3c429.png
   :alt: 09-basic-palette

   09-basic-palette

But there‚Äôs more!

Your users have the ability to define their own themes, and autopalette
will automatically\* recolor your application to their preferences or
needs. (*mostly automatically, or with a little help.)

.. code:: text

   # ~/.autopalette

   palette = Dutron
   render = Truecolor

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23116/40860487-0589dd50-65d5-11e8-9360-2fb29a2d213e.png

Your terminal applications look beautiful as you intend, to everyone, as
they expect.

It is almost two decades since Y2K! And with over 50 years of the
terminal technology behind us, this should be a thing we expect as a
norm.

Autopalette is another attempt at fixing some of these gaps by making it
near trivial to style terminal apps and do the right thing for the
various terminals it runs on‚Ä¶ without the complexity often involved as a
result of the rich legacy of the technology.

Autopalette would not dare exist without the libraries published by
these generous individuals who made it possible to think and write code
in simple mental models that are just right for the task:

-  ``colorhash``: Felix Krull (https://pypi.org/project/colorhash/)
-  ``colortrans.py``: Micah Elliott
   (https://gist.github.com/MicahElliott/719710/)
-  ``colour``: Valentin LAB (https://pypi.org/project/colour/)
-  ``emoji2text``: Sam CB (https://pypi.org/project/emoji2text/)
-  ``ftfy``: Rob Speer / Luminoso (https://pypi.org/project/ftfy/)
-  ``kdtree``: Stefan K√∂gl (https://pypi.org/project/kdtree/)
-  ``sty``: Felix Meyer-Wolters (https://pypi.org/project/sty/)
